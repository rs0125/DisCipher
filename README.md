# DisCipher

This is a discord bot designed to provide crypographic encoding and decoding functionalities within Discord servers.
This project uses discord py, a library that exhaustively implements Discord's APIs in an efficient and Pythonic way.

## Features

Morse Code Encoding: The bot can convert plain text messages into Morse code. Users can simply input their desired text and the bot will return the equivalent Morse code representation.

Morse Code Decoding: The bot can decode Morse code messages back into plain text. Users can input Morse code sequences, and the bot will translate them into readable text.

Caesarean Cipher Encoding: The bot can convert plain text messages into caesar code. Users can simply input their desired text and shifting and the bot will return the equivalent caesar cipher representation.

Caesarean Cipher Decoding: The bot can decode caesar code messages back into plain text. Users can input caesar cipher sequences, along with a shifting key, and the bot will translate them into readable text.

Interactive Commands: The bot offers interactive commands to make Morse code encoding and decoding easy and user-friendly. Users can trigger commands with specified prefixes to interact with the bot and utilize its functionalities.
### Featured Ciphers :
- Morse
- Caesarean Substitution
- Beaumont (in progress)
- Enigma (Planned)

## Contributing

I'm planning to implement all sorts of historical ciphers into the bot.
