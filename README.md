# DisCipher

This is a discord bot designed to provide crypographic encoding and decoding functionalities within Discord servers.
This project uses discord py, a library that exhaustively implements Discord's APIs in an efficient and Pythonic way.

## Features

Encoding: The bot can convert plain text messages into Morse, caesar or ROT3 code. Users can simply input their desired text and the bot will return the equivalent Morse code representation.

Decoding: The bot can decode Morse code messages back into plain text. Users can input Morse code, caesar or ROT3 sequences, and the bot will translate them into readable text.


Interactive Commands: The bot offers interactive commands to make Morse code encoding and decoding easy and user-friendly. Users can trigger commands with specified prefixes to interact with the bot and utilize its functionalities.
### Featured Ciphers :
- [Morse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code)
- [Caesarean Substitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)
- [ROT13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13)

Planned implementation : 
- Case sensitivity in Caesarean substitution
- Transpositional algorithms
- Enigma cipher (naval and Wehrmacht variations)
- Auto Caesarean Decipher 

## Contributing

I'm planning to implement all sorts of historical ciphers into the bot.
