# DisCipher

This Discord bot project is built using Discord.py, a Python library for creating Discord bots. The bot is designed to provide Morse code encoding and decoding functionalities within Discord servers.

# Features

Morse Code Encoding: The bot can convert plain text messages into Morse code. Users can simply input their desired text and the bot will return the equivalent Morse code representation.

Morse Code Decoding: The bot can decode Morse code messages back into plain text. Users can input Morse code sequences, and the bot will translate them into readable text.

Interactive Commands: The bot offers interactive commands to make Morse code encoding and decoding easy and user-friendly. Users can trigger commands with specified prefixes to interact with the bot and utilize its functionalities.
